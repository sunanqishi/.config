      Screencastify is a simple video screen capture software for Chrome. It is
      able to record all screen activity inside a tab, including audio. Just
      press record and the content of your tab is recorded. You can easily
      create screencasts for video tutorials, record presentations etc. It also
      supports desktop capturing, allowing you to record anything on your screen
      (not just tabs).

      Videos are recorded as webm/vp8 files with ogg vorbis audio and can be
      saved to disk or uploaded to Youtube or Google Drive with a single click.
      Screencastify does not depend on any external software (like Java, Flash
      or other plugins). So it also runs on Chromebooks and Chromeboxes.

      Video recording happens completely locally. So your recordings are not
      transferred to any remote system unless you choose to upload them. Your
      video files are stored on a sandboxed local HTML5 file system managed by
      Chrome. When choose to store your recordings on Google Drive, they are
      uploaded to your Google Drive account after recording and removed from
      local storage. This helps to save local storage space, especially on
      Chromebooks and allows access your recordings from other devices.
